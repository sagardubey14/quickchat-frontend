## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. **Debouncing for User Retrieval**
- To prevent excessive API calls while searching for users, debouncing is implemented.
- When typing in the user search bar, the application waits for a specified delay before triggering the API call to fetch user data.
- This improves performance and reduces server load.

### 2. **Optimized Read Receipts with Callbacks**
- Read receipt updates are handled using callback functions.
- This ensures efficient communication between components, preventing unnecessary re-renders and improving overall responsiveness.
